Introduction
=====

Hi!, this is the document that we can work on concurrently with the project reports in order to keep track of the work that we are doing. I suggest that we make good use of this reporting to layout the framework of our final project report while we work on it.


We can start off by talking about the kind of methods we want to explore. I would like to focus on a host of ensemble methods. I suggest we focus on Random Forests, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), and Gradient Boosting (GBA). 

Here's a long, probably useless summary of the subset of the data we are using.
